### Homework

In this file I will list home assignments you need to to **before** coming to class. I will update this file regularly.

### 17 January

- Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you have R and R Studio already installed make sure you've got the latest version.
- Read ch. 1, 2 and 6 from the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Do not get too scared by it: at this stage you just need to understand why people use Git and Github, and then you will gradually learn how to use these tools. 
- Familiarise yourself with the [*Understanding Society*](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/) survey and read Buck & McFall. (2012). ["Understanding Society: Design overview"](http://www.llcsjournal.org/index.php/llcs/article/view/159/168).
